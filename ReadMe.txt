This is a program I made to read books faster.

You can read faster by removing spaces and just having the words being displayed.

Version 2.0:

- Added a trackbar to select 3 speeds.
- Added a Stop button to stop the process.
- Made the method an async and used the await keyword on the task to allow you to stop the task if needed.
- Added Version 2.0 in the menu bar and on the bottom right corner.
